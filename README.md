Labophoto
=========

Labophoto is an C++\OpenGL application that's use a Digital Camera (via gphoto2 library) to scan black & white negatives.

Compilation
-----------
This project is dependent to my external C++ library, so it must be downloaded too to compile this application. (Currently, the library is under the "arcade" repository).
